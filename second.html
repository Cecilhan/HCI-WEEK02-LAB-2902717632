    <p>The north coast area of western Java including Jakarta was the location of prehistoric Buni culture that flourished from 400 BC to 100 AD.
    [24] The area in and around modern Jakarta was part of the 4th-century Sundanese kingdom of Tarumanagara, one of the oldest Hindu kingdoms in
    Indonesia.[25] The area of North Jakarta around Tugu became a populated settlement in the early 5th century. The Tugu inscription (probably 
    written around 417 AD) discovered in Batutumbuh hamlet, Tugu village, Koja, North Jakarta, mentions that King Purnawarman of Tarumanagara undertook
    hydraulic projects; the irrigation and water drainage project of the Chandrabhaga river and the Gomati river near his capital.[26] Following the 
    decline of Tarumanagara, its territories, including the Jakarta area, became part of the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda. From the 7th to the early 13th 
    century, the port of Sunda was under the Srivijaya maritime empire. According to the Chinese source, Chu-fan-chi, written circa 1225, Chou Ju-kua
    reported in the early 13th century that Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda).[27] The source says the port
    of Sunda was strategic and thriving, mentioning pepper from Sunda as among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture, and their houses
    were built on wooden piles.[28] The harbour area became known as Sunda Kelapa (Sundanese: ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮊᮨᮜᮕ) and by the 14th century, it was an important
    trading port for the Sunda Kingdom.</p>

        The first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in 1513 while looking for a route to obtain spices.[29] The Sunda Kingdom
        made an alliance treaty with the Portuguese by allowing them to build a port in 1522 to defend against the rising power of the Demak Sultanate 
        from central Java.[20] In 1527, Fatahillah, a Pasai-born military commander of Demak attacked and conquered Sunda Kelapa, driving out the Portuguese.
        Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta,[20] and became a fiefdom of the Banten Sultanate, which became a major Southeast Asian trading centre.

        Through the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta of the Banten Sultanate, Dutch ships arrived in 1596. In 1602, an English East India Company
        (EIC) voyage led by Sir James Lancaster arrived in Aceh and sailed on to Banten, where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site 
        became the centre of English trade in the Indonesian archipelago until 1682.[30] Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with 
        the English merchants, who were rivals with the Dutch, by allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.[29]
